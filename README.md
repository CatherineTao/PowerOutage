# PowerOutage

## Dataset
The dataset comes from Purdue University and contains major power outages and their causes throughout the United States.  The Dataset can be found [here](https://engineering.purdue.edu/LASCI/research-data/outages/outagerisks).

## Objective
The goal for this project was to predict the causes of major power outages between the Northeast and Central regions.  

# Notes
In [Outages - Part 1](Outages - Part 1.ipynb), this notebook contains the data cleaning process.  Here I assessed the missingness of data and used Hypothesis testing to find the difference of means between the Northeast and Central regions.  

In [Outages - Part 2](Outages - Part 2.ipynb), shows the process of a baseline and final model.  Here I use machine learning to determine the causes of major power outages.  For the final model I chose to use Support Vector Machine to classify cause categories.
